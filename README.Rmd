## Introduction

Estimating phylogenetic trees is crucial in many areas of evolutionary biology.
However, visualizing the relationship between data and trees is not intutive [@baumTT]. To assist with visualizing this relationship, I have created treesiftR, 
an R package that takes subsets of data from a phylogenetic matrix, generates a tree
under parsimony, and scores that tree under both the likelihood and parsimony criteria. The output of the package is a visualization or set of visualizations 
of a tree and characters. Also included is a Shiny application that can be run locally or used via the web without installing any R packages or having knowledge of R.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(treesiftr)
library(phangorn)
library(alignfigR)
library(ggtree)
library(ggplot2)
```



```{r message=FALSE} 
fdir <- system.file("extdata", package = "treesiftr")
aln_path <- file.path(fdir, "bears_fasta.fa")
bears <- read_alignment(aln_path)
tree <- read.tree(file.path(fdir, "starting_tree.tre"))

sample_df <- generate_sliding(bears, start_char = 1, stop_char = 10, steps = 1)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
output_vector <- generate_tree_vis(sample_df = sample_df, alignment = aln_path, 
                                   tree = tree, phy_mat = bears, pscore = TRUE,
                                   lscore = TRUE)
output_vector
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
